Services perform the work being orchestrated by Planners. In Skald, Services are loosely coupled and only interact with their parent Planner. Furthermore, the atomic nature of Services provides a great level of exibility by allowing them to be exchanged as new technology emerges and requirements change.Service is attached to a Planner and performs work associated with that Planner's theme.
